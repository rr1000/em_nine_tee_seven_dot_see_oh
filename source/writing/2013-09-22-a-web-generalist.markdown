The term 'generalist' is often associated with negativity. Some might consider a generalist to be someone that dabbles here and there, but never really understands one domain completely. I tend to disagree with that opinion. I believe a generalist is someone that has many passions. A generalist wants to code the website, deploy and manage it, as well as have a hand in the design process and perhaps even some marketing.

I'm more accustomed to this role coming from the freelance world. There, you'll often find clients asking for a redesign of their website, when in reality they want a redesigned and developed website. One that's easily update-able and hosted so they don't have to worry about it. This takes knowledge of not only design but development, customer service and some server maintenance.

There are of course varying degrees to which someone might be labeled a generalist in a positive sense. In the design world, you may have someone who is considered a generalist because they can produce a polished UI, they know how to conduct some user research, produce a little HTML and CSS. This person is invaluable to say, a creative agency-one that services all types of clients.

In the development world, one might consider a generalist to be a "full-stack developer." Someone who is well-versed in both front-end and back-end code. To a further extent, I would consider someone a generalist if they can easily learn and use a language or framework. Perhaps they're not familiar with any JavaScript MVC but it wouldn't take them more than a weekend to ramp up on one. They've made custom deployment recipes and built applications using Rails and SASS.

There can also be "web generalists," a term of which I classify myself. A web generalist is passionate about all aspects of the web, from the database to the wireframes. They strive for simplicity throughout the application.

Becoming a generalist doesn't happen overnight nor does it ever end. It takes several years to understand the the complexity of just one domain, let alone multiple ones. A true generalist is one that continues to learn. Maintaining complexity is inherently important for both designers and developers. Having the ability to carry out this task in more than one domain is what truly separates a mediocre generalist from a fine one.

Designers are trained to preform many tasks but it seems the industry is more focused than ever on dividing those into [multiple roles with multiple job titles](http://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/).

Designers are getting worse and worse at doing one aspect of design and so they ignore it and latch onto a term that purposefully disregards that aspect. So a UX designer might scoff at the visual design because that's not part of their job. In most cases, outside of huge companies, a designer does pretty much every aspect of what most people consider to be design; visual, UX, UI, Information architecture, research, and branding. That's what designers are trained to do. That's the point of being a designer.

####Designers are trained to:

- Transform complex ideas into simple ones
- Funnel information into an easily digestible packet
- Learn from other designers
- Research proven methods of visual problem solving
- Produce more than one method or solution to a problem
- Minimize the abstraction of ideas from those that are public facing and those focused around the business model
- Vet solutions with both designers and non designers
- Think about proposed solutions in terms of objectivity
- Understand a clients needs even when they don't

...and the list could go on and on but the point is that *all* designers are expected to do these things; not just graphic designers or user interface designers etc. This isn't to say titles aren't useful, they are. They let the candidate know what the primary objective of the job is and that of course is important in finding the right placement. However the skills necessary to all of these jobs as a designer are ubiquitous.

####Design: a brief history of the process

A well accepted definition of design is "a process of planning the form, look, or workings of something before and during its construction" ( [I modified this a bit for the web industry](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+design&oq=define+design&aqs=chrome..69i57.2194j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) ). Design as a process has been debated for centuries and while many definitions of designer or the act of designing exist the process is fairly standard.

Take for example the ["Rational" ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201362988/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=produbooks-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201362988) design model which postulates that the process of design is purely driven by the affective planning of events (read milestones). These events occur in a sequential and logical order starting with a brief (a time where you and the client create a joint document outlining the requirements of the job) and ending with a launch (in most cases including future design iterations and monthly maintenance).

Of course with any school of thought there comes an apposing one. Many arguments against this model state that designers and clients don't work this way. Outcomes are never set in stone and pieces continue to move even though the final proposal has been made. This is true for both client and product teams. While I'll refrain from saying that there's one right way to produce an effective design I will restate that the process of achieving that state is fairly standard. When these unforeseen pieces move the process is just reiterated for that specific task, however in a much more condensed and informal way.

In most cases all designers will face this process. Whether they're consistently focused on user research or working directly with the client on visuals. Because of this it's important to remember that your specific design role is no different from any other design role. The process is the same. The fundamentals are absolute.

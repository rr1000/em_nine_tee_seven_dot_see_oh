Remote work as a designer is both greatly rewarding and somewhat challenging. Add working for a startup into the mix and things can get a bit tricky. When I joined Catalyze it was my first time working remotely and I was extremely excited to get started. I began reading [blog posts](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/) and [books](http://37signals.com/remote/) about how to take make remote working work for me. If you're a developer or software engineer, working remotely is probably something you've done at least once. Maybe you didn't feel like trekking into the office one day or perhaps felt a little under the weather and worked from home. This isn't uncommon. In fact, almost [30 million Americans](http://www.boltinsurance.com/news/miscellaneous/benefits-of-employee-telecommuting-infographic/) work from home at least one day per week.

Though as a designer, working from home can be a bit at odds with how traditional collaboration typically works. In a physical setting there are other designers and project managers around you - asking questions, giving feedback, conversing throughout the day. When working remotely, especially when first starting out, that physical connection and energy is absent. To supplement that connection we, at Catalyze, use a variety of tools to help collaborate on design and development projects.

**Here's a short list of the collaboration tools we use (not contained to design):**

- **[Slack App](https://slack.com):** We use Slack as our primary means of communication at Catalyze. The 'posts' feature in particular has been the most useful as a designer. With the ability to write in markdown and add comments it's a great tool to send and receive feedback on static images and copy.
- **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/â€Ž):** Most are probably familiar with Google Drive. It's fast, easy and convenient to use. Drive excels at creating easy-to-share documents. With the ability to add in-line comments, Drive is great for brainstorming or drafting copy. (Side Note: Slack also integrates nicely with Drive)
- **[Box](https://box.com):** At Catalyze we use Box for syncing and backing up files in the cloud. As a designer, I use box to store anything non-code related - keynotes, PNGs, PSDS, Sketches, wireframes, etc.
- **[Mockingbird](http://gomockingbird.com):** There are [SO](http://www.quora.com/Interaction-Design/Whats-your-favourite-wireframing-tool-and-why) many wireframing tools out there that do [SO](http://uxpin.com/) many things. Because Catalyze is a startup, we tend to use wireframing as a ['scratching'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Creative-Habit-Learn-Life/dp/0743235274) application; this means we take a high-level approach to conceptualize ideas but don't spend too much time working on wireframes. So for us Mockingbird is perfect as it has just the right amount of features and is very easy to use.
- **[Github](http://github.com):** We use Github for project management. We track everything from bugs to design enhancements using Github issues (combined with milestones, wikis, and READMEs).
- **[Google Hangouts](http://google.com/hangouts):** Hangouts is great for everyday conversation as well as face-to-face appropriate interactions. We use hangouts for meetings and daily SCRUM.

That comprises most of the collaboration tools we use on a daily basis. Since Catalyze is a small company, we try to keep it lean here because we have the ability to do just that. Beyond tools, we've also implemented some methods of design production that have helped us produce at a quicker rate. Those methods include:

- **Minimal static files:** Because our design team is so small (just [me](https://catalyze.io/team/ryan) and [Anthony](https://catalyze.io/team/anthony) for now) we are able to skip a lot of static file work. Almost everything I design is completed primarily in the browser.
- **Share prototypes, comment on screenshots:** Because most of what we design is a workable prototype, it's easy to simply put that up online and share that link with the rest of the team. What isn't easy is commenting on that prototype. To remedy this, we create a screenshot of the page and upload as a post to Slack in order to utilize the comments section to leave feedback.
- **Use frameworks and tools:** Creating web prototypes can become tedious if you're constantly having to rewrite a lot basic HTML and Boilerplate code. [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) has been essential in creating prototypes and websites for us. Because it's a static site generator it produces code that we can put up virtually anywhere with little to no setup. We've been using DigitalOcean on the design team to help us host websites and prototypes. DigitalOcean has some [great resources](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles) to get designers up to speed with server management.

Our process is not perfect and we continue to improve it everyday. It's my hope that this post inspires a reader to consider working remotely as a designer, because it can work. Keeping things simple is key.

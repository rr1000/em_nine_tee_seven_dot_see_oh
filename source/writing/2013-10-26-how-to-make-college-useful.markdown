> “If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library.” ~ Frank Zappa

Going to college is becoming less than a privileged experience in the United States since the opportunities to in-debt oneself have become increasingly abundant.

Receiving loans is as easy as signing your name, and the requirements to graduate seem to dwindle in difficulty each year as schools strive for high-ranking statistics.

During my college experience (2008-2013), I found that going to class was less about understanding and applying a skill or gaining insight about your potential career and more about learning how to simply acquire skills. I believe this is easy to recognize in hindsight but certainly more beneficial to one’s education if an individual is aware of this difference while attending school.

There are plenty of tips and tricks to get you through a course or to pass a test, but the best suggestions are those that just make sense. There is no magic here - just plain, old common sense mixed with a little bit of experience. 

If I had to choose to pass along any information to those enrolling or still attending college, this list would be it.

##Don't go to college to be taught a skill. Go to college for the opportunity to be given the time to learn something.

"Join a club." That's the first piece of advice that I received from an RA during my first year in college. It wasn't terrible advice but it also wasn't the greatest. Joining a club can be super beneficial but I think most people just walk through the motions. They join a club *just* to be in a club. They don't seize the opportunity, and that's exactly what I'm imploring you to do. Seize the opportunity by any means necessary. Discuss with professors after class about the subjects, topics and studies that catch your interest. Find that on-campus job that will help you move forward towards your career. Spend late nights in the studio or in the lab working on projects other than school work. Trust me, you'll have the time.

##The majority of what's applicable in the real world will come from outside work, not class work.

I can't stress this enough. It is imperative to be able to get the most out of your education. If you want to be a great designer, then go and find some freelance design work. Shit, I don't usually advocate pro-bono work, but while you're trying to build up your portfolio it's worth the risk. Finding a way to extend what you've learned during classes into other disciplines will be the best way to find what you want out of a career. That discovery doesn't come from the classroom.

##Think about solutions objectively. Something isn't good or bad, correct or wrong. Certain solutions work or are chosen over others for a reason.

Beginning as a design major, I learned this point early in my college years. During critiques we would always be corrected if we said words like "good" or "awesome" or "shitty." Those words can convey a certain amount of information but it's the surrounding context of your judgement that really helps the person to understand and also helps you to better your ability to be subjective. When you talk with friends about movies or about a test, try your best to convey your part of the discussion in a subjective matter. It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't what you expected and the acting was subpar compared to the potential of the plot. This does wonders when it comes time to convince someone to hire you.

##Learn how to manage your money. 10% is paid to yourself every paycheck for the rest of your career.

This is less a piece of advice about college and more about just life in general. Understanding finance is not reserved for certain roles within a business. Everyone in the company, and therefore you if you plan to work after school, should understand how to make money.

##Ask questions. Seriously do it. Want to write a novel? Ask someone who has done it.

[Nathan Kontny](http://ninjasandrobots.com/i-dont-have-any-connections) recently wrote a blog post about making connections and how to reach out to people you've never met before. I often think of the internet as this great big tool of opportunity that billions of people use every single day they are alive, and yet they don't understand the potential of that device. The best advice I could give in regards to meeting new people is to be creative. 

##When you graduate and enter the workforce, you will understand very little about your chosen domain. Always be listening, always be learning.

I used to think that the products I created and the concepts I constructed were good. I would sit proudly at my keyboard to admire the creation I had just made, and with the click of a button I'd fall down from that high and land broken on the floor. I'd struggle with constant impostor syndrome and I still do everyday. That's good. It's good to feel bad and unwanted. It'll keep you hungry. 

Be sure to always stay hungry.

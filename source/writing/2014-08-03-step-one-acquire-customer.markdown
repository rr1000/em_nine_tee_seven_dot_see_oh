Creating a business, whether it be a digital startup or a brick and mortar retail store, requires some amount of capital (even time spent building a product can be a capital investment). Physical businesses typically self-fund but it's not uncommon for a restaurant to seek out a VC firm or other investors willing to take a stake in its company [3], [4]. Tech startups tend to look for funding through accelerator programs and/or angel investors. Of course numerous startups (both tech and non-tech) are [bootstrapped](http://37signals.com/bootstrapped).

I think it's safe to assume that the overwhelming majority of funded startups have a **good** idea. In other words, an idea that attracts people. An idea that solves a real problem. <span class="hl">And most importantly, an idea that creates customers</span>. If we can agree with that assumption, then we must consider with another; startups fail for 'x', but 'x' does not indicate the lack of a good idea. Therefore I think it's safe to say that good, even great, ideas are not the end-all be-all of the startup world. However, I wouldn't go so far as to identify them as worthless [5].

One of the best tests to determine if you do in fact have a good idea is to talk to people, potential users, about it. In practice, this is great. You'll most likely receive a good amount of valuable feedback. Communicating with your potential users marks such an important step that it's actually one of the fundamental ideas of the lean startup process [6]. However, if we go back to our assumption that 'x' is not a lack of a good idea then what's the importance of talking with potential users (other than to confirm that you're in the 10th percentile)? To grossly oversimplify the answer to this question, it's **finding money**. When you talk with potential users and customers, your goal should be to find their money and make them give it to you. "Are they willing to pay for it?" should be at the forefront of your mind when speaking with potential users about your business idea.

The importance lies with the false reality of believing at face value that someone loves your product and says they'd use it. Until their money makes it into your bank account, take everything they say with a grain of salt. Acquiring this mindset from the beginning also forces the founding team to focus on the only thing that matters in the business world, performance, often measured by financial, institutional and organizational success. (Of course Silicon Valley has shown some very odd behavior in the last 3-6 years where [companies that hemorrhage money raise insane IPOs,](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=TWTR) but I wouldn't count on that trend to continue for another 5 years).

Because you're focusing on the one thing that matters in business you'll most likely deliver a product that people love (that's why they're giving you money for it). If you can't find people to give you money you are either **a.)** delivering a sub-par product or **b.)** in the consumer space. If you're in the consumer space I have no advice for you besides...good luck (which of course is no advice at all). On the other hand, if you're delivering a sub-par product then you know that it's time to go back to the drawing board. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything about your product is wrong. It could be as simple as one killer feature, but it's important to realize this early before you spend too much time engineering a product that no one wants.

So how do you get people to give you money if you don't even have a product yet? The good thing about being a B2B business is that if you can truly show how your product improves a company's performance (no matter how small of a contribution to that uptick) they'll more than likely pay you for it. If you're delivering a product that greatly improves their performance (combined with a price insensitive market like healthcare, government contracting, etc.) they'll even give you money upfront. This is what I identify as a 'kickstarting' business model. I use the word 'kickstart' because it essentially follows the same principles that guide crowd funding platforms (like kickstarter). <span class="hl">You prototype a product, promote it, and then collect money from people with the promise that you'll deliver something in the near future.</span>

The initial sales cycle looks something like this:

- Idea (Creating a solution to a problem; creating a customer)
- Research (Talking with industry insiders, most likely not those with purchasing power but those that have intimate knowledge about the market)
- Prototype (Non-functional but polished)
- Sell (Talking with industry insiders that have purchasing power)
- Refine (Once you've sold a few units you'll most likely have feature requests that keep coming up; good thing you haven't built anything yet)
- Build (Starting with feature priority)
- Release (Release versions of the product to your new customers incrementally) **
- Deliver (A polished product)

** By allowing early access to the product, you help insure customer satisfaction as well as provide a sense of importance. When you're selling, you'll typically provide the customer with a rough delivery date (e.g. 6 months). If at 3 months you have 50% of the product built, you should fork that and deliver it to your customers early with the expectation that you are releasing a preliminary beta to loyal and early adopters. In most cases they'll be pleasantly surprised that they are receiving part of the product 3 months ahead of schedule. <span class="hl">A tangentially related benefit of this step is that you can solicit feedback that you can incorporate into the final release</span>.

The 'kickstart' method has two obvious benefits:

- You have a customer
- You're creating a product of value

By sharing this method I hope to give those with truly great ideas a possible path toward building a successful business.

At Catalyze we pride ourselves on moving our products forward through attention to detail and always listening to our users. A big part of that is having the capacity to learn and grow our products quickly. We recently redesigned our user dashboard to help them manage applications and messaging instances better.

One of the first orders of business was to rethink the structure and aesthetic of the user interface. We had been using bootstrap out of the box since the initial release and it was time to spend some effort on creating something more unique. If you've logged in recently the image below should look familiar.

If you were a user of the previous version you'll notice right away that the app now has a fluid container that expands the full width of the window. We felt this was more in line with how traditional apps function and worked particularly well with the new layout.

While the bootstrap core still exists we now have a custom Catalyze theme that sits on top of it. We took a fairly pragmatic approach in that we developed a style based mostly on utility rather than trend. All in all the design is flat but has subtle drop shadows where there's a need for increased contrast (For example, in the application archive above, the app containers have subtle drop shadows to separate them from the background color).

The dashboard access screens have also been drastically simplified as shown below.

The application and messaging instance creation process was another point of focus when redesigning the dashboard. We moved the bare essentials of creating an app into a modal. This process of course still isn't flawless and we're continuing to simplify with each new iteration of the design. Eventually we'd like to add an organization automatically in the background, thus allowing a user to create an app or messaging instance even quicker.

One of my favorite new interactions with the dashboard is the ability to edit an app's or messaging instance's information inline without moving away from the application view. Below you'll see a gif demonstrating this action.

The motivation behind this decision was to continue making interactions with the dashboard as seamless as possible. Being able to edit the app's information without having to reload the browser or navigate to another page can be a huge time saver when managing an entire archive of live applications.

That's it for now. We hope you'll find the new design both visually appealing and easier to use. As always suggestion and feedback is always welcome. You can direct those comments [here](mailto:hello@catalyze.io).

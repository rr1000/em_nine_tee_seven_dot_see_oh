[Wilson Miner](http://wilsonminer.com/) is a well respected product designer who has worked for some of silicon valley's top tech companies. In 2011 he gave a talk at [Build Conf](http://2011.buildconf.com/) about the past, present, and future of design.

[His talk](http://vimeo.com/34017777) wasn't necessarily about visual design or engineering design. It was more about design systems and how those systems shape us and our environment. But don't get me wrong, it was about much more than that.

In the end Miner postulates that the 21st century will be shaped by the products we surround ourselves with. I bet you can guess what those products are. I highly encourage you to take the time to watch his talk. Below I've included some notes I took while watching.

- The car is an environmental effect. It reshaped the way we live. Just look outside your window.
- The car as an engineered machine has not changed in 100 years
- The environment on the other hand has changed 10 fold around this one object
- "All media are extensions of some human faculty, mental or physical"
- Clothing extends our skin just as a car extends our feet.
- Our extensions alter the way we think and see ourselves in the world
- Electricity is just an extension of the neural circuitry in the brain
- The car shaped out environment in the 20th century
- The screen will shape our environment in the 21st century
- "The only intuitive interface is the nipple. Every thing after that is learned"
- We always make assumptions that our users know something, that they already know
- The assumptions are changing fast now
- The environment is always changing so we need to start letting go of what we know
- Things don’t stick around as long as they used to
- “At times of change, the learners are the ones who will inherit the world, while the knowers will be beautifully prepared for a world in which no longer exists.” ~ Alistair Smith
- Don’t change how the room looks. Change how the room feels. React to the room. Don’t change it. (Artist Robert Irvin)
- Don’t build a single product that will die in a year. Build an ecosystem that allows that product to live forever
- Humans want to exist
